                <h1>AEPS bailout to COST $981 MILLION annually</h1>
<div>
    <p>Citizens Against Nuclear Bailouts has released the following statement in response to draft nuclear bailout legislation that has been made public.</p></div>
     <p>Adding nuclear power generation to the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) is a bailout, and there is no hiding its crippling cost to consumers.</p>
    <p>The Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania has evaluated the proposal and detailed in an article that projects this nuclear bailout legislation would force Pennsylvania ratepayers to pay an additional $981 million annually in higher electricity bills.</p>
<p>This unprecedented, unnecessary proposal would add a new, third tier of 50 percent to Pennsylvania’s AEPS in the form of a renewable energy credit to the benefit of three profitable corporations: Exelon, FirstEnergy Solutions and Talen Energy.</p>
  <p><strong>In fact, nuclear energy corporations operating in Pennsylvania profited $640 million in 2018, according to PJM’s Independent Market Monitor. Combine that with a $981 million tax, and these corporations would stand to pocket a profit of more than $1.6 billion.</strong></p>
<p>To put the size and scope of this cash grab into perspective, the cost of this proposed nuclear bailout is more than Exelon already received from New York ($580 million annually) and Illinois ($230 million annually) combined. Another nuclear operator, PSEG, recently received a $300 million annual bailout in New Jersey, and now regulators are questioning whether a bailout is justified based on the true financial reports of PSEG’s nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>Citizens Against Nuclear Bailouts continues to ask legislators to stand with their constituents over profitable nuclear corporations and shareholders.</p>

                <h2>PA legislators seek support for nuclear bailout tax that would pad pockets of profitable corporations</h2>

                <div>
                    <p>Citizens Against Nuclear Bailouts urges lawmakers to protect ratepayers from the harm of a nuclear energy bailout</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Tell lawmakers to say No Nuke Bailout</h3>

                    <p>Citizens Against Nuclear Bailouts (CANB) has issued the following statement in response to Sen. Aument's and Rep. Mehaffie's co-sponsorship memos, which each outlines legislative actions intended to bail out certain nuclear power generation facilities in Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>Recently, a co-sponsorship memo was circulated in the legislature that outlines a course of legislative action that would burden Pennsylvania consumers with higher electricity bills to fund a nuclear bailout tax, which would benefit already profitable nuclear power corporations.</p>
                    <p>Citizens Against Nuclear Bailouts — a diverse coalition of Pennsylvania citizens’ groups, energy consumers, power generators and energy, business and manufacturing associations — calls into question the need for a nuclear bailout tax when Pennsylvania’s nuclear power plants are projected to have made more than $600 million in profits in 2018, according to PJM Interconnection's Independent Market Monitor.</p>
                    <p>Four of Pennsylvania’s five nuclear power plants were profitable with the exception of Exelon’s Three Mile Island (TMI), a single reactor that is inefficient and uncompetitive.</p>
                    <img src="NoNukeBailoutPA.github.io/images/CANB19-84328_Infographic-1200x628_v4 (1).jpg" alt="PA nuclear plants are profitable" width="1200" height="628">
 
      
                    <p>TMI should either be closed or Exelon should use a fraction of its own hundreds of millions of dollars in profits to subsidize the plant instead of turning yet again to consumers for a handout.</p>
                    <p>This is a boardroom decision to close TMI, not a legislative issue, and ultimately this latest plea for a bailout is nothing more than corporate greed disguised as green.</p>
                    <p>Proponents will claim adding nuclear power generation to Pennsylvania’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) is not a bailout. However, a subsidy from consumers simply so that corporations can increase their profits is clearly a bailout no matter how it is derived or what it’s called.</p>
                    <p>This proposal will essentially re-regulate Pennsylvania’s competitive electricity markets by taking away consumer choice and forcing consumers to buy nuclear energy--no matter the cost.</p>
                    <p>We urge lawmakers to reject this nuclear bailout tax that will raise electricity bills, and allow competitive markets to continue to work for Pennsylvania’s consumers.</p>

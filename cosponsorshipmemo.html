                <h1>HB11 throws ratepayer money at already profitable nuclear corporations
</h1>
<div>
<p><i>Citizens Against Nuclear Bailouts has issued the following statement in response to the introduction of House Bill 11, a nuclear bailout proposal released today by State Rep. Tom Mehaffie.</i></p>
<p>“Pennsylvania legislators must ask themselves this question: side with already profitable nuclear corporations, or oppose House Bill 11 and stand with constituents in opposition to this proposed legislation that will raise consumer electricity bills significantly?</p>
<p>“The lead sponsor of this bill has confirmed a price tag of at least <b>an additional $500 million, year after year, INDEFINITELY, </b>in higher electricity costs, hurting Pennsylvania’s most vulnerable citizens, including seniors and those on low or fixed incomes, as well as small businesses and manufacturers.</p>
<p>“The notion that if we do nothing nuclear power plants will simultaneously shut down and prices will be impacted is disingenuous at best — Exelon, FirstEnergy Solutions and Talen Energy are making too much money to justify shutting down.</p>   
<p>“The PJM Interconnection Independent Market Monitor projects that Pennsylvania’s five nuclear power plants collectively netted <b>more than $640 million in profits in 2018</b>, and Peach Bottom nuclear power plant recently applied to extend its license through 2054.</p> 
<p>“What does Rep. Mehaffie know that industry experts who have all testified that competition and reliability aren’t a problem do not to justify this nuclear bailout cash grab.</p> 
<p>“The Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) was intended to advance the development of new and innovative technology, not to bail out old technology developed in the 1960s that is leaving a generational legacy of nuclear waste. Furthermore, nuclear power relies largely on imported uranium from foreign interests, including Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p> 
<p>“Adding already profitable nuclear power plants to the AEPS is a bailout that would significantly increase consumer electricity prices, eliminate consumer choice and fundamentally change the way Pennsylvania’s competitive energy markets operate.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers need to leave boardroom decisions out of legislation. <b>We urge them to stand with Pennsylvania ratepayers to say NO to a nuclear bailout.</b></p>

                <h2>PA legislators seek support for nuclear bailout tax that would pad pockets of profitable corporations</h2>

                <div>
                    <p>Citizens Against Nuclear Bailouts urges lawmakers to protect ratepayers from the harm of a nuclear energy bailout</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Tell lawmakers to say No Nuke Bailout</h3>

                    <p>Citizens Against Nuclear Bailouts (CANB) has issued the following statement in response to Sen. Aument's and Rep. Mehaffie's co-sponsorship memos, which each outlines legislative actions intended to bail out certain nuclear power generation facilities in Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>Recently, a co-sponsorship memo was circulated in the legislature that outlines a course of legislative action that would burden Pennsylvania consumers with higher electricity bills to fund a nuclear bailout tax, which would benefit already profitable nuclear power corporations.</p>
                    <p>Citizens Against Nuclear Bailouts — a diverse coalition of Pennsylvania citizens’ groups, energy consumers, power generators and energy, business and manufacturing associations — calls into question the need for a nuclear bailout tax when Pennsylvania’s nuclear power plants are projected to have made more than $600 million in profits in 2018, according to PJM Interconnection's Independent Market Monitor.</p>
                    <p>Four of Pennsylvania’s five nuclear power plants were profitable with the exception of Exelon’s Three Mile Island (TMI), a single reactor that is inefficient and uncompetitive.</p>
                    <img src="NoNukeBailoutPA.github.io/images/CANB19-84328_Infographic-1200x628_v4 (1).jpg" alt="PA nuclear plants are profitable" width="1200" height="628">
 
      
                    <p>TMI should either be closed or Exelon should use a fraction of its own hundreds of millions of dollars in profits to subsidize the plant instead of turning yet again to consumers for a handout.</p>
                    <p>This is a boardroom decision to close TMI, not a legislative issue, and ultimately this latest plea for a bailout is nothing more than corporate greed disguised as green.</p>
                    <p>Proponents will claim adding nuclear power generation to Pennsylvania’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) is not a bailout. However, a subsidy from consumers simply so that corporations can increase their profits is clearly a bailout no matter how it is derived or what it’s called.</p>
                    <p>This proposal will essentially re-regulate Pennsylvania’s competitive electricity markets by taking away consumer choice and forcing consumers to buy nuclear energy--no matter the cost.</p>
                    <p>We urge lawmakers to reject this nuclear bailout tax that will raise electricity bills, and allow competitive markets to continue to work for Pennsylvania’s consumers.</p>
